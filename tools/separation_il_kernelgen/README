This is a small tool for generating AMD IL kernels for
separation. They do not support the aux_bg_profile option, but I don't
think that's ever actually used. This also would be trivial to add
back in if ever needed.


To generate a kernel, it takes 3 arguments.
  1: Number of streams for the kernel.
      If using FLEXIBLE_KERNEL, this will be the maximum number of
      streams. Otherwise, the fixed number of streams.

  2: Device type.
      This is one of the names of the values for CALtargetEnum with the
      CAL_TARGET_ prefix dropped. e.g. "770" and "Cypress" will be create a kernel for
      CAL_TARGET_770, or CAL_TARGET_CYPRESS respectively. This is case
      insensitive.

      IL is supposed to be forward compatible to new GPUs. OpenCL is
      only supported on Radeon 4xxx and later, and then doubles are
      also required, so the 770 type should be the oldest which will
      work on all targets where this is expected to work.

      A more recent / specific version may be slightly faster. For
      example, Cypress has a double precision native_reciprocal
      instruction for double which will be slightly faster.

  3: Output file; e.g. "kernel_Cypress_3stream.il"


There are a couple of hardcoded constants you can change for slightly different behaviour.

FLEXIBLE_KERNEL:
  By changing the definition of FLEXIBLE_KERNEL to 1, you can have a single
  kernel that can handle a variable number of streams up to some limit,
  but will be somewhat slower.

USE_KAHAN:
  By changing this to 1, can use Kahan summation

IL_MAX_CONVOLVE:
  Maximum acceptable value for convolve. This should always match the
  same value as in the reference generated OpenCL binary. This isn't
  actually used by the IL kernel, since it doesn't support the
